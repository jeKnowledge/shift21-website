          <h1>What is it?</h1>
          <p> Shift APPens is a Hackathon where participants have 48 hours to create an application, defending it in a final pitch in front of a carefully chosen jury.
            We aim to foster healthy competition and an exchange of knowledge from the tech world among the participants, all taking place in a relaxed environment. We gather developers, designers and entrepreneurs of different technological fields, from north to south of the country.
            On the way to its 7th edition, our Hackathon is organized by the University of Coimbra's Computer Science Students Organization and by jeKnowledge, a junior enterprise of the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the University of Coimbra.
            We can promise you fun, competition and friendships! If you have never participated, come join us!</p>
